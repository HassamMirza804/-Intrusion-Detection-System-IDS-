### Intrusion Detection System
An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is a security tool that monitors a computer network for suspicious activity and identifies potential threats. It acts as a vigilant guardian, analyzing traffic patterns to detect and alert you to unauthorized access or malicious behavior.

### Demonstration & Capabilities
A video demonstration of this project is available below.




The demonstration showcases the system's ability to detect and respond to simulated threats in real time. Due to security and privacy policies, actual attacks are not performed. Instead, three distinct scripts are used to simulate network threats: a port scan, a brute-force attack, and a DDoS attack.
As the simulated traffic hits the Flask server, the IDS model analyzes the data. Upon detecting a malicious pattern, an alert is immediately printed to the command-line interface, confirming the model's capability to identify and respond to threats.
